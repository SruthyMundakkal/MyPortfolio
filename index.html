                    I am Sruthy passionate IT web programming second semester student in Truro Campus. I already 
                    finished my diploma in Computer Engineering from India. It was under Kerala State Technical board 
                    od Education. The sparkling element of mine is I have work experience from IT firms. One of them as Junior
                    Engineer Trainee and other one is apprentice traineein government Sector. Both were front end development for me.

                    <br>
                    
                    In addition I attended two government authorized meetings related to the project when I worked as apprentice trainee.
                    That gave me the ideal knowledge on client requirements, what the actual project and what was our team role.

                    <br>

                    in this semester. As well as this is my portfolio that pop up my resume, and the projects that I done in my previous 
                    semester.
